# Music-Player
This is my simple Music Player project which i have created using HTML, CSS and Javascript. I have use HTML and CSS to give decent look to my music player and javascript is doing all the behind the scene stuff, meaning handling all the functionalities of my project. My simple motive behind building this project is to learn and develop my practical skill in javascript. I actually enjoyed my time creating this project and I think somewhere it helped me building my knowledge.

#Installation
If you wish to use this music player, there's nothing much to do just clone the repo and download the file in your system.
